Description:
This is a C++ design and implementation of a inventory container to be used in games. Goal is to make it easily extendable and suitable for multiple purposes.

The aim of this project is to implement a container (inventory) that can hold multiple bags. Bags can hold items which eventually can also be bags. Initial design and implementation can  hold only
one level of bags.

Each bag can be set a name and a limit of how many items it can hold.
Inventory can contain multiple bags and the limit can be set

Example uses:
- A player inventory, one or more bags
- A player shared stash, one or more bags
